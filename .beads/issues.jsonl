The business needs to attribute costs to individual customers so that:\n- Finance can report cost-to-serve per customer segment (premium, standard, enterprise)\n- Customer success teams can identify high-cost accounts for optimisation outreach\n- Margin analysis can compare revenue per customer against their infrastructure cost\n\nThe customer cost fact table must join service-level costs with the customer dimension, respecting SCD2 versioning so that historical costs reflect the customer segment that was active at the time.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\nAC-1: Cost records are attributed to customers and persisted in the database, queryable by customer and date.\nAC-2: Each fact record is linked to both the customer dimension and the service dimension via foreign key relationships.\nAC-3: Customer attribution respects SCD2 versioning — costs are joined to the customer version that was current on the usage date.\nAC-4: Re-running the pipeline for the same date range does not create duplicate records (idempotent).\nAC-5: NULL or missing cost values are handled consistently (coalesced to zero with an audit trail).\nAC-6: The fact table supports aggregation by customer segment for finance reporting.\nAC-7: PII controls are maintained — the fact table references customer surrogate keys, never raw PII.\n\n## Controls\n\n- C-04 (PII Masking): No raw PII in fact table; surrogate key references only\n- C-06 (Data Quality): NULL handling, type casting, referential integrity\n- C-07 (Reproducibility): Deterministic output from same inputs\n- C-08 (Idempotency): Re-run safety, no duplicate records\n\n## Test Taxonomy\n\n- t1_logic: Cost attribution correctness, SCD2 temporal join logic, NULL coalescing\n- t2_contract: Schema validation, foreign key integrity to dim_customer and dim_service\n- t3_quality: Data quality checks (no orphaned foreign keys, no NULLs in required fields, valid date ranges)\n- t4_access: PII controls — verify no raw email/phone leaks into fact table\n- t5_idempotency: Re-run produces identical results, no duplicates\n- t8_integration: End-to-end load from raw CUR and customer snapshots through to queryable fact table\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Depends on: dim_service (Sprint 2 — delivered)\n- Depends on: dim_customer (Sprint 2 — delivered)\n- Depends on: raw_cur extract layer (Sprint 1 — delivered)\n- Depends on: S008 (Daily Cost Fact Table) — customer costs build on the daily cost grain","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"258467816+mcgrath-bpt@users.noreply.github.com","created_at":"2026-02-14T21:14:10.372777+01:00","created_by":"mcgrath","updated_at":"2026-02-15T09:12:26.423324+01:00","closed_at":"2026-02-15T09:12:26.423324+01:00","close_reason":"All ACs met.

Full claim+comment trail visible in bead history. This was a Sprint 2 retro action and is now demonstrated across a full sprint.\n\nW2: **AI-008 followed** — Architecture handbook and ITOH runbook updated DURING implementation (REFACTOR commits 5ad5c09 and da10e81), not deferred to post-governance as happened in Sprint 2. PDL tasks T004 and T005 completed inline.\n\nW3: **AI-007 followed** — Clean single PRs per story to main. No stacked branches. PR #5 (S008) and PR #6 (S009) each merged independently. Dependency sequencing (S009 waited for S008 merge) worked correctly.\n\nW4: **TDD discipline held** — Both stories followed RED→GREEN→REFACTOR with commit evidence:\n  - S008: 14f99ef → aa9d313 → 5ad5c09 (chronological, verified)\n  - S009: 7ebd5f5 → 382a4c6 → da10e81 (chronological, verified)\n\nW5: **QA report thorough** — Full AC traceability (14 ACs mapped to 47 tests), TDD commit verification, lint check, and explicit FW-007 acknowledgement. QA clearly stated scope limitations (test coordination, not independent UAT).\n\nW6: **Governance kickoff done upfront** — Control applicability assessment (Step 2) performed before BA story creation. This was an improvement over Sprint 2 where governance was partially retroactive. 6 active controls identified, PDL tasks assigned, evidence requirements defined before development started.\n\nW7: **Strong test coverage** — 47 new tests (17 S008 + 30 S009) covering t1_logic, t2_contract, t3_quality, t4_access (S009), t5_idempotency, t8_integration. Zero defects. Zero regressions across 153 total tests.\n\nW8: **Control evidence comprehensive** — C-04 (PII) verified with 4 dedicated tests. C-06 (DQ) verified with NULL handling, precision, referential integrity, and completeness tests. C-07/C-08 verified with idempotency tests. All evidence system-produced.\n\n---\n\n## WHAT TO IMPROVE\n\nI1: **bd CLI syntax errors — agents guessing instead of reading --help** (RECURRING)\n  - Governance Agent used --text flag (doesn't exist) for bd comments add\n  - SM Agent used colon syntax for queries (should be equals)\n  - Same root cause as Sprint 1 gate type error (AI-001)\n  - Root cause: Framework CLAUDE.md Beads Quick Reference has incorrect/incomplete syntax\n  - Framework bug raised: agentic-SCRUM-a4o (not yet fixed)\n  - Impact: Wasted turns, process gap comments cluttering run-log\n  - Frequency: Every sprint so far (Sprints 1, 2, and 3)\n\nI2: **AI-009 — BA skipped PO discovery dialogue** (NEW)\n  - BA read CLAUDE.local.md (\"fact tables, PO priority\") and proceeded directly to story creation\n  - No PO decisions recorded, no clarifying questions asked, no assumptions documented\n  - Compare to Sprint 2: BA recorded 5 explicit PO decisions before story creation\n  - Sprint 3: zero discovery records — BA inferred scope, sequencing, and design choices unilaterally\n  - PO raised this as a process gap in run-log Step 5 (post-hoc)\n  - Risk: stories may not reflect PO intent; no audit trail of what was decided vs assumed\n\nI3: **FW-007 — UAT gap still unresolved** (CARRIED FORWARD from Sprint 2)\n  - QA provides test coordination (verifying Dev tests pass, mapping to ACs)\n  - No independent UAT with separate test cases\n  - All 153 tests are Dev-authored — no independent verification of business logic\n  - G3 approved with this acknowledged gap (same as Sprint 2, CRQ-DRY-002 precedent)\n  - Three sprints now without resolution — should be escalated or formally accepted\n\nI4: **Session 7b retro collation was adequate but could be richer**\n  - SM collation in Step 7b captured the key items but was produced in a single pass\n  - No cross-referencing with Sprint 1/2 retro patterns beyond listing carried-forward items\n  - Opportunity: SM should compare current sprint gaps against prior sprint retros to identify trends\n\n---\n\n## ACTION ITEMS\n\n### New Actions\n\n**AI-009**: BA must record PO discovery decisions as a named step in the run-log before story creation begins. Even a single-line PO instruction requires a discovery record confirming interpretation and assumptions. (Owner: BA-AGENT.md update)\n\n**FW-009**: Fix bd CLI quick reference in ASOM framework CLAUDE.md — incorrect syntax documented. Add note: \"Always run bd \u003ccommand\u003e --help on first use each session.\" (Relates to agentic-SCRUM-a4o already raised. Owner: Framework team)\n\n### Carried Forward\n\n**FW-007**: UAT gap — QA provides test coordination only, not independent UAT. Three sprints without resolution. Recommend: either implement independent UAT or formally document acceptance of current Dev+QA coverage model with risk acknowledgement. (Owner: Framework team)\n\n### Sprint 2 Actions — Status Assessment\n\n**AI-005** (Dev must bd --claim and log comments): **DONE** — Sprint 3 demonstrated full compliance across both stories. Claim+comment trail verified by QA and Governance. Recommend: mark as closed, retain as standard practice in agent instructions.\n\n**AI-006** (BA stories describe WHAT not HOW): **DONE** — Sprint 3 stories (S008, S009) described business outcomes without file paths, column names, or SQL patterns. QA confirmed ACs were business-oriented. Recommend: mark as closed, retain as standard practice.\n\n**AI-007** (Single PR per story, no stacked branches): **DONE** — Sprint 3 had clean single PRs (#5, #6). No stacking. Dependency sequencing respected. Recommend: mark as closed, retain as standard practice.\n\n**AI-008** (Dev updates architecture + ITOH during implementation): **DONE** — Sprint 3 Dev updated both docs during REFACTOR phase (commits 5ad5c09, da10e81). Not deferred. Recommend: mark as closed, retain as standard practice.\n\n---\n\n## SPRINT COMPARISON\n\n| Metric | Sprint 1 | Sprint 2 | Sprint 3 |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Stories delivered | 3 | 3 | 2 |\n| New tests | 67 | 39 | 47 |\n| Cumulative tests | 67 | 106 | 153 |\n| Defects | 0 | 0 | 0 |\n| Process gaps | 3 | 7 | 4 |\n| TDD verified | 3/3 | 3/3 | 2/2 |\n| Gate | G3 (CRQ-DRY-001) | G3 (CRQ-DRY-002) | G3 (CRQ-DRY-003) |\n\n**Trend**: Process gaps reduced from 7 (Sprint 2) to 4 (Sprint 3). Sprint 2 retro actions (AI-005 through AI-008) all resolved — no recurrence. New gaps are BA discovery (AI-009, new) and recurring CLI syntax issues (FW-009, framework-level). FW-007 (UAT) persists but is stable/acknowledged.\n\n**Velocity**: 2 stories vs 3 in prior sprints — appropriate given increased complexity (SCD2 temporal joins, PII controls, multi-dimension fact table). Test density increased (23.5 tests/story vs 13 in Sprint 2).\n\n---\n\n## PARTICIPANTS\n- SM Agent (facilitator)\n- Dev Agent (S008, S009 implementation)\n- QA Agent (test coordination)\n- Governance Agent (G3 verification)\n- BA Agent (story creation)\n- PO (Human — G1 approval, G3 approval, AI-009 observation)","created_at":"2026-02-15T08:55:29Z"}]}

BA: Discovery + story drafting (PO correction: BA boundary violation)\n  GAP: Run-log not created, Governance kickoff skipped\n  2-4. Dev: TDD implementation (S004, S005, S006) — 39 new tests\n  GAP: Stories not claimed, no comments during implementation\n  5. PO: Process review — identified --claim and comment gaps\n  6. Human: G1 gate — PRs merged (chained PR issue, catch-up PR #4)\n  7. QA: Test coordination (NOT UAT — gap identified, FW-007)\n  8. Governance: Evidence verification + PDL assessment (gaps 4-5 flagged)\n  8b. Dev: PDL doc updates (architecture + ITOH)\n  9. Human: G3 gate approved (CRQ-DRY-002)\n  10. SM: Sprint closure (stories + epic closed)\n  11. SM: Retrospective (4 sprint actions + 2 framework items)\n\nARTIFACTS: 2 loaders, 2 DDL, 1 DML, 39 tests, 2 PDL docs updated\nMETRICS: 106 tests total, 0 defects, TDD 3/3 verified\nPROCESS GAPS: 7 identified (all documented honestly in run-log)\nFRAMEWORK ITEMS: FW-007 (UAT), FW-008 (Governance kickoff order)\n\nKEY LESSON: The value of dry runs is in the gaps they surface. Sprint 2 found more process gaps than Sprint 1 (7 vs 3), which means the PO is getting better at challenging the framework — not that the framework is getting worse.\n\nSprint 2 complete.","created_at":"2026-02-11T05:42:34Z"}]}
